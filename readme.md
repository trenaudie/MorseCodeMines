# Morse Code Mines 
This is the final assignment for the Mines Paris C++ Athens Course.
The goal of this repository is to provide C++ code for encoding and decoding Morse Code, from/to English text. 


## Examples 
We provide the following examples
Encoding a sample Latin-alphabet string of words such as "Hello World" and saving it to disk as a .WAV file.


Decoding a morse code, saved locally in a .WAV file, into a Latin-alphabet string of words.
